INFS3634 - Mobile App Development
Group Assignment for Group 33;
-	Darien Mocatta
-	Daniel Vale
Tutor: Jeremy
Class: Wednesdays 11am – 1pm
App Name: Learn Android

GitHub Repository:

https://github.com/DarienMocatta/LearnAndroid2

Guidelines for Building App:
-	No overall guidelines, app is self-contained and does not have any points of failure or crashing
-	Since the app was coded on a surface (very slow computer) loading UI elements can take a few seconds at times with a black screen. If you are also using a slow computer this is normal.
Key Features of App:
-	YouTube API implemented via fragments which enables AppCompat classes for use of navigation bar
-	SQLite database to stored data about question objects
-	Quiz with countdown timer and multiple choice
-	Quiz has persistency when tilted horizontally and vertically, retaining countdown and question selection
-	Overall amazing learning experience to teach Jeremy a thing or two about android.
Peer Review:
-	Equal contributions from both Darien Mocatta and Daniel Vale
